# My SICP exercises using Clojure

My new year's resolution for 2013 is to read the book "Structure and
Interpretation of Computer Programs" and do as much exercises as possible.
I also planned to learn using Clojure, so I'm using it instead of Scheme.
Everything should be ready until the Christmas of 2013.

## Usage

```
lein run e1.6
> (cbrt 8) = 2.000005
```
